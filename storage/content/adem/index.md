ADEM is community driven citizen science project initiated by [Timelab](http://timelab.org), Ghent.
The goal of the project is to raise public awareness about urban air pollution through 
the development on an open source fine dust sensor. The sensor is meant to be mounted on 
a bike, so as to give the user real time feedback and, at the same time, 
it sends the data to a server.

The logo and <a href="http://ik-adem.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> were created together with the whole ADEM team.

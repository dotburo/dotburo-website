*Why do people keep photographs?* is a “database movie” project by <a href="http://www.tessagroenewoud.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tessa Groenewoud</a>.
Every day a video is automatically generated based on a passage from the crime novel ‘Mrs. McGinty’s Dead’ (1952) by Agatha Christie.
Each word from the fragment is used to select the day’s highest ranking image result in the search engines of Bing, Google or Yahoo.

<br>
The <a href="http://whydopeoplekeepphotographs.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project website</a> displays the daily video
and the archive of past generated movies. The generation of the HD video is done through Python and FFmpeg,
the latter takes care of the actual video, as well as the subtitles and rolling credits which reference the original URLs
of the images.  

<br>
The project is currently on show at <a href="http://marres.org/nl/programme/now/marres-currents-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marres Currents #4: Running Time</a> until February 12, 2017.

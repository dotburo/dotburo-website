Logo, visiting cards, letterhead and website for the transcendental research group at Ghent University. 
The logo is based on a metaphor by Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Pure Reason:
  
<br>
“The light dove, in free flight cutting through the air the resistance of which it feels, could get the idea that it could do even better in airless space. Likewise, Plato abandoned the world of the senses because it posed so many hindrances for the understanding, and dared to go beyond it on the wings of the ideas, in the empty space of pure understanding.”

Tessa Groenewoud presents her project in Maastricht (NL) and on 
<a href='http://www.marres.org/programmas/marres-currents-4-tessa-groenewoud/' target='_blank'>Marresâ€™s website</a> 
from 14/12 until 12/02/2017.  
<br>
The project is a daily generated *database movie* developed in Python, which is used to fetch images through
 the major search engine API's. To edit these stills into a "movie", the project uses FFmpeg, which
also generates the burned-in subtitles as well as the rolling credits referencing the original URL of the images.

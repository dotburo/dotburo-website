Tessa Groenewoud presents her project in Maastricht (NL) and on 
<a href='http://www.marres.org/programmas/marres-currents-4-tessa-groenewoud/' target='_blank'>Marresâ€™s website</a> 
from 14/12 until 12/02/2017.

The project, [developed by dotburo](https://github.com/pecuchet/wdpkp-4){target=_blank rel=noopener}, is a daily generated *database movie*. 
Coded in Python it fetches images through the major search engine APIs and edits these into a "movie" with FFmpeg. In the process the program
also generates the burned-in subtitles as well as the rolling credits, which reference the original URIs of the fetched images.  

You can find more info on the

A funny and simple javascript (ES6) implementation of old school arcade game leader board inputs...

<br>
The module was originally developed for a game on big Android screens where the native
keyboard could not be used. This was an easy solution to let the player enter 
her initials easily in the leaderboard, without having to develop or require a full-blown on-screen keyboard. 
The code is on [Github](https://github.com/pecuchet/arcade-score-initials){target=_blank rel=noopener} 
and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/arcade-score-initials). 
There is also [a demo](https://pecuchet.github.io/arcade-score-initials/):

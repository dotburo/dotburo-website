A video made for by writer Dirk Elst. The video was part of the group show *Characters makes stories* at NICC
in Antwerp (September 2011). “A writer interviews himself, hesitates, says nothing and gives away
the story to the subtitles and the spectator/reader. Inspired by *La mort de l’auteur* by Roland Barthes.” (Dirk Elst)
